    <b>Outstanding finance:</b>
    <div class="mb-10">
      <p>
        If there’s still finance owing on a car, it technically belongs to the finance company,
        so the ‘owner’ has no right to sell it. However, some people will try to sell a car before
        they’ve finished paying off the finance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re buying a vehicle from a dealership, outstanding finance agreements are often settled at the point
        of sale. This is quite common, but you should discuss it with them before you hand over any money and get
        written confirmation that they’ll pay off the outstanding amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as finance is owing, the car belongs to the finance company; even if you bought it in good faith.
        If you become the ‘owner’ of that car, you’ll inherit any debt, and the finance company will want
        that settled. If you have already handed over money for the car, you may well have to resort to court action,
        and that could cost a significant sum
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s why it’s important to get evidence that the finance has been paid off before you buy the vehicle.
        If you’re unable to get this from the seller, a full vehicle check will give you the details of the finance
        company so you can contact them to confirm it’s been paid off.
      </p>

    <b>Check vehicle recalls:</b>

    <div class="mb-10">
      <p>Find out if the manufacturer has recalled a vehicle, part or accessory because of a serious safety problem.</p>

      <p>
        You need to get your car fixed or replaced by the manufacturer if there’s a problem.
        You will not usually have to pay for any repairs or parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        By law, you’re responsible for ensuring your car is in a roadworthy condition, so ignoring
        a safety recall could land you in hot water with the police.
      </p>


      <p>
        It could also affect any car insurance claim you make.
      </p>

      <p>
        A collision found to have been caused by a mechanical fault that you’ve failed to have remedied despite
        a recall notice could invalidate your insurance.
      </p>

      <p>Not only that, the car’s value may be reduced when you come to sell it on.</p>

      <p>
        If you’re thinking of buying a second-hand car, it’s worth checking to see if it has ever had a recall
        notice and whether there’s any evidence that the fault was fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you buy from a dealer, they should have already checked for outstanding recalls before the car is sold.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if it’s a private sale, there’s a possibility that the owner could have ignored a past recall,
        so it’s always best to do a background check before parting with your cash.
      </p>
    </div>

    <b>Stolen V5C check:</b>
    <div class="mb-10">
      <p>
        Ask to see the V5C vehicle registration certificate (‘log book’). Make sure it has a ‘DVL’ watermark,
        and the serial number is not between BG8229501 to BG9999030, or BI2305501 to BI2800000. If it is, the V5C might be
        stolen - call the police as soon as it’s safe to.
      </p>
    </div>

    <b>Check Proof of ownership:</b>

    <div class="mb-10">
      <p>
        Check the full vehicle registration document (V5C) in your name together with proof of
        address to match the registered address and unaltered and ‘in date’ new keeper supplement (V5C/2)
        together with a ‘verifiable’ bill of sale and proof of name and address to match the new keeper supplement
      </p>
    </div>

    <b>Check if car is Stolen or cloned has different VIN:</b>
    <div class="mb-10">
      <p>
        True story: "Last week me and my husband bought a car from private seller.
        We did all HPI checks and even spoken to the police who confirmed that the car is fine.
        However, we found out today that the car is stolen. The seller used one of the stolen V5
        forms and cloned the VIN number and registration so when we checked it it looked ok but in fact it
        had different VIN number than the one on the window. Police left the car with us and told us that
        insurance company will contact us and we might be able to buy it from them. We lost £10,000 and don't have
        neither car or money"
